super simple c++ reaction time test. only loops once.
the program tells you to get ready to hit the enter button. then after a random amount of time the the user is told to hit the enter button. at the same time a timer is started, recording how long it takes for the user to press enter. 
once the user presses enter, the program displays the time in miliseconds. also for fun, the program rates your score from fast to average to bad.

I chose this mini project because there is so much fun in a simple reaction time test, and i have always wondered how acurate the online ones were. So i made one myself in c++.
